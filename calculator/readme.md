# Creating an interactive calculator

Calculators can perform a useful storytelling function, inviting users to interact with information and generate surprising results (the twist!).

They are used widely in journalism. The Wall Street Journal's interactive team head Jon Keegan, for example, says one of the best stories his team made was "a [calculator we did on mobile phone plan prices](https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/08/01/introducing-wsjs-wireless-savings-calculator/). It's not something newspapers would have in the past used to do in traditional journalism" ([Usher 2016 p120](http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/53paw9sp9780252040511.html)). A more emotive example can be found on the website Mother Jones, who published the story '[What If Your Income Grew As Fast As the 1 Percentâ€™s? Try Our Calculator](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/12/calculator-what-if-your-income-grew-fast-1-percent/)', while the Liverpool Echo published '[The Wage Gauge: How does your salary compare to other Merseysiders?](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-merseyside-average-salary-compare-10830841)' and the Manchester Evening News ran with '[How much spending money have you lost for your summer holiday after Brexit?](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/brexit-euros-exchange-holiday-interactive-11589754)' and the BBC used a calculator for '[Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30500372)'
