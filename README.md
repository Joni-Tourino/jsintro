# JS intro

This repository has some basic files which you can **clone**, add to, and then add back in to the repository using a **pull request**.

They provide a useful introduction to JavaScript, but also to collaborating on a project using GitHub.

## The setup

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

* An account on GitHub
* You have downloaded and installed GitHub on your local machine (laptop, whatever)

## Step 1

Log in to GitHub and go to the repository at [https://github.com/paulbradshaw/jsintro](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/jsintro)

Click on the *clone* button in the upper right corner: it looks like a TV/monitor with a downward arrow. You can find it next to the **Download ZIP** button.
